Disk Scheduling Simulator

A simple and interactive project demonstrating how various disk scheduling algorithms work in an operating system.
This project is part of Project-based-learning for Operating Systems.

# Overview

Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced.
This simulator helps visualize and compare multiple algorithms by showing:

Total head movement

Order of servicing requests

Algorithm efficiency comparison

Graphical representation of head movement (if included)

# Features

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

CSCAN (Circular SCAN)

LOOK

CLOOK

Custom input for:

Request queue

Initial head position

Disk size / cylinder range

# What You Will Learn

How OS manages disk scheduling

How seek time is reduced using different algorithms

Trade-offs between fairness and efficiency

How to implement algorithm visualization

#Future Enhancements

GUI-based visualization

Compare algorithms side-by-side

Include real disk latency models

Web-based simulator version
